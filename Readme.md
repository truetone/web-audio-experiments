#Web Audio API Experiments
This page has 4 oscillators:

1. Sine wave
2. Square wave
3. Sawtooth wave
4. Triangle wave

All have a single-octave major scale with volume control.

## To Do

* Right now, if you stop an oscillator, you have to reload the page to start it again. Make it so oscillators can start and stop.
* Provide a broader range of notes
* Add more effects like reverb
